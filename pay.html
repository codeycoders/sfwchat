# Wobbly's SFWCHAT.
# I'm no legal expert, so I'll tell this to you in a very simple manner.
# Don't copy this stuff. Am I going to do anything about it? No.
# Just please don't, I worked hard on this as I'm sure you're working
# hard on reading this, because if you thought that you could just copy this
# and I'd be fine with it you aren't only wrong, but you are also stupid.
# Partially.
