# Don't copy this stuff. Am I going to do anything about it? No.
# Just please don't, I worked hard on this as I'm sure you're working
# hard on reading this, because if you thought that you could just copy this
# and I'd be fine with it you aren't only wrong, but you are also stupid.
# Partially.

		          <p>
		            Welcome to the new, <b>experimental</b> homepage of
		            sfwchat / codeychat! Here are a few things you should know
		            about the new layout.
		          </p>
		           <div class="row">
								<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
								  <ul>
								    <li><b>Enter can now be used!</b> Previously you had to press "submit plox" in order to submit your messages. With the new, updated version of the site the <b>enter</b> key works reliably!</li>
								    <li><b>Still the same!</b> The only real difference is cosmetic - it should look a lot more professional now.</li>
								    <li><b>You can revert to the old layout!</b> Don't like the new one? Just press "old layout" up in the top.</li>
								  </ul>
								  <ul class="actions">
										<li><a onclick="register()" class="button primary">Register</a></li>
										<li><a onclick="login()" class="button primary">Login</a></li>
									</ul>
								</div>
								<p>
								  Confused? First time here? <br>
								  You can register for a new account by clicking on the Register button.
								  However, if you already have an account you can just click Login.
								  If you have already signed in on this device, you'll be automatically
								  signed in and redirected to the main page.
